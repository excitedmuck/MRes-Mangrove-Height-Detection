Assessing Mangrove Canopy Heights in Myanmar using GEDI & Sentinel-2 for Effective Monitoring


## Data sources
This repository contains the code that investigates mangrove height changes utilizing GEDI data. As part of the project, we delve into the intricate details of mangrove ecosystems, leveraging GEDI's capabilities to track and understand variations in mangrove height over time for the year 2019. 


## Results
We compare the 4 final models' predictions of the 2019 heights
